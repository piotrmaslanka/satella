Satella is an almost-zero-requirements Python 3.5+ library for writing
server applications, especially those dealing with mundane but
useful things. It also runs on PyPy.

Satella uses [semantic versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Satella contains, among other things:

* things to help you manage your [application's configuration](satella/configuration)
* a fully equipped [metrics library](satella/instrumentation/metrics)
    * alongside a fully metricized [ThreadPoolExecutor](satella/instrumentation/metrics/structures/threadpool.py)
* helpful [exception handlers](satella/exception_handling)
* common programming [idioms and structures](satella/coding)

Most Satella objects make heavy use of `__slots__`, so they are memory friendly and usable on
embedded systems, where memory is at premium.

Change log is kept as part of [release notes](https://github.com/piotrmaslanka/satella/releases).
The [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file is only to track changes since last release.

Full [documentation](http://satella.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
is available for the brave souls that do decide to use this library.

code taken from elsewhere on the internets, so this is copyright (c) respective authors.

# Running unit tests

Tests run by default on 
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/github/piotrmaslanka/satella).
Just build and run the attached 
[Dockerfile](Dockerfile). 
These tests run on Python 3.8

They pass on Windows too, but some tests 
requiring POSIX-like functionality are skipped.
