class measure:
    """
    A class used to measure time elapsed. Use for example like this:

    >>> with measure() as measurement:
    >>>     time.sleep(1)
    >>>     print('This has taken so far', measurement(), 'seconds')
    >>>     time.sleep(1)
    >>> print('A total of ', measurement(), 'seconds have elapsed')

    You can also use the .start() method instead of context manager. Time measurement
    will stop after exiting or calling .stop() depending on stop_on_stop flag.

    Time elapsing starts after the counter is created. If you wish to start it manually,
    please specify create_stopped=True

    When instantiated and called with no arguments, this will return the time elapsed:

    >>> a = measure()
    >>> time.sleep(0.5)
    >>> assert a() >= 0.5

    You can also decorate your functions to have them keep track time of their execution, like that:

    >>> @measure()
    >>> def measuring(measurement_object: measure, *args, **kwargs):
    >>>     ...

    This will also correctly work on methods, correctly inserting the measurement object after
    self/cls:

    >>> class Test:
    >>>     @measure()
    >>>     def measuring(self, measurement_object: measure, arg1):
    >>>         ...

    You can also measure how long does executing a future take, eg.

    >>> future = get_my_future()
    >>> measurement = measure(future)
    >>> future.result()
    >>> print('Executing the future took', measurement(), 'seconds')

    In case a future is passed, the measurement will stop automatically as soon as the future
    returns with a result (or exception).

    Note that in order to reuse a single counter you must .reset() it first. Just calling .start()
    after .stop() will result in the timer being resumed instead!

    Note that if you're measuring generators, this will count the time passed from the measure()
    was called till the generator finishes.

    Note that if you're using the decorator form, this object will be first copied and then
    passed to the function/future. This is to prevent undefined behaviour during multithreading.
    Also, the timer that you pass to this function will be started/not started, depending on what
    you set earlier. .reset() will be called on a copy of this object.

    This can also be used to write custom timeouts, eg.

    >>> with measure(timeout=5) as m:
    >>>     while not m.timeouted:
    >>>         ... do something ...
    >>>         if condition:
    >>>             break
    >>>     if m.timeouted:
    >>>         raise WouldWaitMore('timeout hit')

    :param stop_on_stop: stop elapsing time upon calling .stop()/exiting the context manager.
        If this is set to False then .start() and .stop() won't work and calling them will raise a
        TypeError.
    :param adjust: interval to add to current time upon initialization
    :param time_getter_callable: callable/0 -> float to get the time with
    :param create_stopped: if this is set to True, you will manually need to call .start()
    :param timeout: a time limit, after exceeding which the property `timeouted` will be true
