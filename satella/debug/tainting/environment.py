    A round of tainting. Taints will be invalidated at the end.
    Basically any Python opcode that relates to tainting will
    be tainted itself.

    As an added extra, function values will be tainted as well if at least one of the parameters has been tainted

    Use like this:

    >>> with TaintingEnvironment() as env:
    >>>     a = taint(a)
    >>>     b = a + 5
    >>>     ...

    .. warning:: Using environment tainting will slow down your Python scripts since they install a per opcode handler.

    .. warning:: Using functions that take at least one tainted argument is supposed to return a tainted result,
        but I couldn't get that shipped in time at this involved some serious tweaking with the Python bytecode.
